A simple, efficient web-based system built by our trucking company to track and manage flatbed gear and inventory like tarps, straps, chains, binders etc.

## ğŸ§  Why We Built This

We specialize in **open deck trucking**, and managing equipment across dozens of trailers and drivers has always been a headache. 

This tool helps us:
- Keep track of gear assignments to trailers/drivers
- Know what we have in stock (and what's missing)
- Track gear usage history with a basic audit log
